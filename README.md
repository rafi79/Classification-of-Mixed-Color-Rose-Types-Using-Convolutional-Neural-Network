We created our own dataset of 538 photos of six different kinds of roses for the automated classification of roses. The dataset's images were collected from stock photography, Flickr, and Google Pictures. After that, we used the dataset to train our own effective CNN models, and we examined the outcomes using a number of different parameters. All things considered, our CNN model performs admirably when it comes to classifying the species present in the dataset. In order to investigate the variations in the outcomes, we also used the same experimental setup on the dataset's greyscale version in the following phase.
